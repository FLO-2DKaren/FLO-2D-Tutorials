Installation Instructions
=========================

Document below provides details of installing QGIS and FLO-2D plugin.

To install QGIS, we recommend using `OSGeo4W 64 bit installer <http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup-x86_64.exe>`_.

During installation, select **Advanced Install** > **Install from Internet** > **All Users** > Path to download > **Direct Connection** > The default available download website

A new window will appear to **Select Packages**. Select the following packages from the **Desktop** section:

- qgis-dev: 3.x.x
- qgis-ltr: 3.16.x

(Keep clicking on **Skip** until the latest version appears).

For future update/upgrade, with a new release of QGIS, you can run the installer and the new packages will appear.
