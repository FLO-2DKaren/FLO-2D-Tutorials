===============

Before this project can be completed, it is necessary to get the data.

In the example below, it is assumed that user is generating a hydraulic model from scratch. First step to build a model, is to create a new database, where all the model files will reside.

Creating a new database
-----------------------
To create a new database:

In QGIS, FLO-2D Plugin **Settings Button**

.. figure:: img/settings.png
	:align: left
	:alt: Creating a new model database
	:height: 50
	:width: 50

A new window will appear:

.. figure:: img/settingsdialog.png
  :align: left
	:alt: Creating a new model database

	1. Click **Create**
	2. In the new window,
	3. Type in the database name and hit **Save**
	3. Select the projection in the next window
	* Set the default **Grid cell size** and the **Manning's n**

Click **OK**

.. figure:: img/

As you can see, based on the projection, the plugin sets the appropriate unit (metres or feet).
